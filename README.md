## Project Overview

The goal of the project is to create a functional prototype of a restaurant reservation system. The application supports three levels of user roles:

1. **User** – reserves tables, browses restaurants and their menus.
2. **Restaurant Admin** – manages their own restaurant, availability, and handles reservations.
3. **Main Admin** – oversees the entire system, handles disputes, and has access to system statistics.

The application belongs to the category of **Reservation Management Systems**.
